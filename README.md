# Live Weather Displaying Application using APIs and Excel

I have use https://openweathermap.org/ for getting the weather Information
I have use Pandas for Excel Operations and requests for Open Weather API Handling in Python 

There 2 Excel Files
1. Containing Supported Cities Names
2. Containing the Actual Application - Live-Weather.xlsx

The reason for making the cities file separated is due to file reading and writing operations

There is main.py file while loads the Live-Weather.xlsx and checks for all Rows and then updates all necessary rows
